<p>I'm a web developer from Melbourne, Australia, currently living and working in Sydney. I am finishing up a double degree of CompSci and Business at the University of Technology Sydney while contracting as a software engineer.</p>

<p>When I was in high school I taught myself Korean, and have a general fascination for languages. This probably accounts, at least in some part, for why I am a software developer. I love discovering new programming languages and frameworks, though I usually will develop in the JVM (Java, Scala, Groovy) to put food on my table, and Ruby for fun.</p>

<p>I have also been playing piano and keyboards since I could barely talk and hope to retire in a very large estate somewhere in the countryside where I can write music in peace and quiet.</p>
