<p>I'm a web developer from Melbourne, Australia, currently living and working in Sydney. I am finishing up a double degree of Computer Science and Business at the <a href="http://www.uts.edu.au/" target="_blank" >University of Technology Sydney</a> while contracting as a software engineer.</p>

<p>When I was in high school I taught myself Korean, and have a general fascination for languages. This probably accounts, at least in some part, for why I am a software developer. I love discovering new programming languages and frameworks, though I usually will develop in the JVM (Java, Scala) to pay the bills, and Ruby for fun or side projects.</p>

<p>I am an avid book lover and while partial to science fiction and fantasy (Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Asimov), I also enjoy the occasional classic Dickens or Austen. I also have a healthy appetite for non-fiction, particularly about business, and especialy those challenging the traditional product or marketing function (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843170/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=1278548962&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=159184021X&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0PHTV816A40PCNDRR9V3">'Purple Cow' by Seth Godin</a>).</p>

<p>I love playing piano and keyboards, and have been since I was 5 years old. I write music occasionally, but tend to keep it to myself. Hopefully some day I can devote more time to it and share it with the world.</p>
