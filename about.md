<img src="/assets/headshot.png" alt="Headshot" width="200"/> I'm an Australian-American musician, composer, and writer living and working in Melbourne (Naarm). 

For the last 15 years I've been working in the software industry, first as a software engineer, then as an engineering manager and people leader. My latest stint in this profession has been spent at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com), a company I joined in 2017 in California, and now work for in Melbourne. I'm still rather fond of it.

I've had a successful career in technology, and I'm grateful for it. But as I've gotten older I'm realigning my focus to something very important to me: music and storytelling. You may have something in life you know you'll regret not doing when you're there on your death bed. For me, this is music and storytelling. The arts.

I have much to lose, and I'm already running late.
