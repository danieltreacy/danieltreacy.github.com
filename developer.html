<p>I am currently employed as an application developer for <a href="http://www.maxusglobal.com/">Maxus</a>, a media agency in Sydney. My role involves working on innovative projects for the organisation and its clients.</p>

<p>Right now I'm working as a software engineer for <a href="http://www.mlc.com.au/">MLC</a>, the investment banking arm of the <a href="http://www.nab.com.au/">National Australia Bank</a>. I started there in February 2010 as an intern, and after 10 months was offered a contract role. During my time at MLC I worked with enterprise web applications, primarily written in Java and the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a>. I also experienced working in an Agile environment on a Scrum team.</p>

<p>Prior to MLC, I was freelancing as a web designer/developer through my solo agency <a href="http://www.creativon.com.au/">CreativON</a>. I still do a little bit of freelancing on the side, but it is not my main focus, and I'm trying to move away from thin-client front-end design.</p>
  
<p>My first real experience was as an intern at an Australian startup, <a href="http://www.buzznumbers.com.au">BuzzNumbers</a>. It was my first year of university and I wanted to ditch my retail job and find something more in line with my career. I had a great experience and was in many ways a stepping stone into life as an IT professional.</p>
