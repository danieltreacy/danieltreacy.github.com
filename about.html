<h2>About myself</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I was born in Melbourne, Australia to an American mother and Australian father. I currently live in Sydney.</li>
  <li>I hold a US passport. After I was born my grandmother encouraged my mother to get me registered as a citizen born abroad. While I grew up in Australia and consider myself an Australian, I lived and travelled in America for 3 years, and am proud to be a US citizen.</li>
  <li>I work for <a href="http://www.maxusglobal.com">Maxus</a>, a media agency, as a software engineer and technologist. I'm having a blast working with some very talented people in what I feel is a very exciting industry ripe for technological innovation. Check out my <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/danieltreacy" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile for my work history.</li>
<li>While I may not be a stereotypical nerd, I love programming and building systems that do amazing things. My first language was PHP, and my first <em>professional</em> language was Java. While tedious and verbose, Java is an extremely mature language (developmentally speaking) and the JVM is a workhorse platform worthy of any production server. I learnt a lot from Java. I also started dabbling in Scala and want to look into other JVM languages in the future. My current job involves a lot of Ruby, and I use it as my primary scripting language, for prototyping, and for most of my own browser-based projects. I am not a fan of mobile web frameworks as they don't give the user the best possible experience for their hardware. I'm keenly awaiting the day when that changes.</li>
  <li>I also play piano, keyboard, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electone">organ</a> and have done since I was five. I love writing music, and can lose touch with reality for hours on end playing and composing. I have owned acoustic pianos, organs, and keyboards, but my current partner in crime is a <a href="http://www.korg.com/m50" target="_blank">Korg M50</a> synthesizer workstation which satisfies my every need.</li>
  <li>In addition to writing my own music, I am a huge appreciator of others' music. I am generally quite eclectic as far as genres are concerned, but my favourites are electro, indie rock and pop, folk, all kinds of jazz, and have recently acquired a taste for experimental and ambient music. Good remixes or covers make my spine tingle.</li>
  <li>I got married in 2010 to a woman I don't deserve, and I consider myself a happy man.</li>
