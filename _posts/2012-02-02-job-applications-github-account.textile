title: The problem with job applications using a GitHub account

Not all of us have very much (or very recent) code there.

Personally speaking, most of the code I've written (and therefore most of the systems I've built) in the last 2 years is the property of my employer at the time and I either do not have access to the code any more, and/or I am not allowed to show anyone outside the company.

I admit I could be contributing more to open source - in which case I would have something to show on GitHub, but for one reason or another, I haven't done much thus far. It's unfortunate because I think evaluating a developer's code is a great way to gauge competency and depth of understanding.

Guess I should start contributing more open source.
