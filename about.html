<h2>About myself</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I was born in Melbourne, Australia to an American mother and Australian father. I currently live in Sydney.</li>
  <li>I hold a US passport. After I was born my grandmother encouraged my mother to get me registered as a citizen born abroad. While I grew up in Australia and consider myself an Australian, I lived and travelled in America for 3 years, and am proud to be a US citizen.</li>
  <li>I got my first job when I was 21. My parents discouraged me from working when I was in high school, preferring me to focus on my studies. My first role was as a salesperson for a <a href="http://www.harveynorman.com.au" target="_blank">computer retailer</a>. I enjoyed it for the most part, but didn't agree with the company's culture which prioritized margins and commission over customer benefit. My first <em>real</em> job was as a summer intern for a Sydney social media startup, <a href="http://buzznumbers.com.au/" target="_blank">BuzzNumbers</a>. That was 2008. After that I did freelance web design and development for 2 years until starting another internship at MLC, an investment bank and fund manager as a Java developer. After the internship I continued to contract for them for another year. Say what you want about enterprise, I learnt a ton, met some great mentors, and earned a little more business sense in the process. I now work for <a href="http://www.maxusglobal.com">Maxus</a>, a media agency, as an app developer and technologist (still not sure what that means). So far I'm having a blast working with some very talented people in an exciting industry.</li>
<li>I'm a software engineer. I'm not the stereotypical nerd in many ways (no neckbeard, decent social life), but I love programming and building systems that do amazing things. My first language was PHP, and my first <em>professional</em> language was Java. While tedious and verbose, I love Java for its stability, security, and infinite number of third party libraries. From Java I started dabbling in Scala and want to look into other JVM languages in the future. I taught myself Ruby a few years ago; it feels young and spunky in comparison to Java (ironic that it is in fact older than Java) and I use it as my primary scripting language, for prototyping, and for most of my own projects.</li>
  <li>I also play piano, keyboard, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electone">organ</a>. I have done since I was five. I love writing music, and can lose touch with reality for hours on end playing and composing. I have owned acoustic pianos, organs, and keyboards, but my current partner in crime is a <a href="http://www.korg.com/m50" target="_blank">Korg M50</a> synthesizer workstation which satisfies my every need.</li>
  <li>In addition to writing my own music, I am a huge appreciator of others' music. I am generally quite eclectic as far as genres are concerned, but my favourites are electro and synth, indie rock, folk, jazz and funk, and have recently acquired a taste for experimental and ambient music. Good remixes or covers make my spine tingle.</li>
  <li>I got married in 2010 to a woman I don't deserve, and I consider myself a happy man.</li>
