<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/149/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/sandwich.jpg" /></a>Well that was quick. After getting frustrated with Squarespace's airtight control over simple things like, oh I don't know, editing the HTML of your pages, I decided to bail. So I decided to write it myself using <a href="http://www.github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, and is running on my VPS (hosted by the good people at <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/" target="_blank" />Slicehost</a>).
  
The blog is pretty basic right now, but I'm hoping to make it prettier over time. </p>
