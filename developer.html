<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>A list of the software projects I have worked on. In some cases I cannot name the client or link to the live project for various reasons.</p>

<h3>Commercial Software</h3>

<p>Software that I have written for money.</p>

<h3>Front-end work</h3>

<p>I was a front-end designer for a few years. Unfortunately a lot of the work I did at that time was as a subcontractor so I cannot put a reference to my work here. I also have lots of design concepts for pitches I didn't win that I cannot put up here (I'm thinking of rebranding them to deidentify the client). That, therefore, leaves me with the following design projects I can show to the world without getting into a lawsuit.</p>

<ul class="projects design">
