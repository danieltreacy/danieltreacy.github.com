<h3>History</h3>

<p>Right now I'm working as a software engineer for <a href="http://www.mlc.com.au/">MLC</a>, the investment banking arm of the <a href="http://www.nab.com.au/">National Australia Bank</a>. I started there in February 2010 as an intern, and after 10 months they offered me a position as a contractor. It's a great place to work overall, though like any enterprise has its fare share of challenges. What makes MLC different, I believe, is that they have technical minded-people in key leadership positions, enabling them to continue to invest in their online strategy.</p>

<p>Prior to MLC, I was freelancing as a web designer/developer through my solo agency <a href="http://www.creativon.com.au/">CreativON</a>. I still do a little bit of freelancing on the side, but it is not my main focus, and I'm trying to move away from thin-client front-end design.</p>
  
<p>My first real experience was as an intern at a web design agency, <a href="http://www.shiftedpixels.com.au">Shifted Pixels</a>. It was my first year of university and I wanted to ditch my retail job and find something more in line with my career. It was there I met <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nickhac">Nick Holmes a Court</a> who was a partner there, and effectively, my boss. I really appreciated the short but meaningful experience I gained working at Shifted, and I continue to keep in touch with Nick and the great work he's doing in his social media monitoring startup, <a href="http://www.buzznumbers.com.au" target="_blank">BuzzNumbers</a>.</p>
