title: iTunes lack of streaming service is a game-changer
---

I've been using <a href="http://www.rdio.com">Rdio</a> for the last few weeks and have recently signed up as a subscriber after trying it out. Having access to virtually any artist or album on demand, with the ability to sync with my iPhone for offline listening is seriously rad. I've almost never opened iTunes (for music, that is) in the last few weeks and unless Apple can offer a superior subscription-based streaming service, I don't see that changing.
